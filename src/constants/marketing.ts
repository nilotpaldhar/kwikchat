		id: "faq-pusher",

			"Because Vercel doesn't support native WebSocket connections. Pusher offers real-time capabilities that work seamlessly in a serverless deployment.",

		id: "faq-realtime",
		question: "Is messaging real-time?",

			"Yes â€” messages are updated live via Pusher, and the interface feels instant thanks to TanStack Query's optimistic updates.",

		id: "faq-files",
